## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines the sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) of speeches.
- **Topic Modeling**: Identifies key themes and trends over time.
- **Party Classification**: Uses **BERT** to classify and attribute speeches to specific parties.
- **Historical Insights**: Tracks linguistic and ideological changes across decades.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Core language)
- **PyTorch & Hugging Face Transformers** (For BERT-based NLP tasks)
- **Polars & Pandas** (For data processing)
- **Poetry** (For dependency management)

## Installation
```sh
poetry install
```

## Usage
### Running Analysis
To analyze speeches, run:
```sh
poetry run python main.py
```
For it to run you need to have the speeches.csv and factions.csv in /data/raw/OpenDiscourse/ after that the XML files will be downloaded and turned into parquet file/polars df. For the XML download you have to create a .secrets.toml with api_key = "your_api_key" from bundestag api.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of Bundestag speeches from 1949â€“2025, preprocessed and stored in parquet format.
